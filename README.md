## Bash Script For Generating a Multiplication Table

## Project Requirements: 

**User Input for Number:** The script must first ask the user to input a number for which the multiplication table will be generated.

**Choice of Table Range:** Next, ask the user if they want a full multiplication table (1 to 10) or a partial table. If they choose partial, prompt them for the start and end of the range.

**Use of Loops:** Implement the logic to generate the multiplication table using loops. You may use either the list form or C-style for loop based on what's appropriate.

**Conditional Logic:** Use if-else statements to handle the logic based on the user's choices (full vs. partial table and valid range input).

**Input Validation:** Ensure that the user enters valid numbers for the multiplication table and the specified range. Provide feedback for invalid inputs and default to a full table if the range is incorrect.
**
Readable Output:** Display the multiplication table in a clear and readable format, adhering to the user's choice of range.

**Comments and Code Quality:** Your script should be well-commented, explaining the purpose of different sections and any important variables or logic used. Ensure the code is neatly formatted for easy readability.

# Variable: Initializing i with 1

# Asking if the user wants a full or partial table

This is where you get to give the user an option of choosing either a full multiplication table or a partial multiplication table.

## Example of a full multiplication table for user's input

![full_table](Project_1_images/full_table.jpg)

## Example of a partial multiplication table for user's input

![partial_table](Project_1_images/partial_table.jpg)

## This is the last part of the input script.

just in case the user inputed a wrong or invalid option in a any of the requisition aspect, the user will be directed or instructed to run the script again and choose from the available options.

As it is shown below.

# The Output of the Scripts.

## Permission

Give executing permission to group, user, and other users and display how exactly it looks.

## Running the scripts to display  the output of it.

## Accepting the user's input and use it for the next scripts.

This is for the full multiplication table.

Example: when the user entered number 4 for the multiplication table.

![Run_the_full](Project_1_images/Run_the_full.jpg)

This is for the partial multiplication table.

Example: if the user entered 8 for the multiplication table.
          Entered 7 has the startqing number
          Entered 3 has the ending number

This illustrates, in a situation whereby the user entered a wrong or void input.
